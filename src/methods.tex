\subsection*{Mantel Analysis based Methods}
    Mantel Analysis \com{check against langauge in\cite{dutilleul2011spatio}} are set of method base around the
    Mantel statistics and is focused assessing measuring the linear association between two square distance matrices
        of same dimension.
    Given two matrices of distances $X$ and $Y$ the Mantel statistic is defined to be dot product the upper triangular
    portion of the distance matrices as vectors:
    \[z_{m} =  \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{i,j}Y_{i,j}\]
    Likewise, there is also the standardized mantel statistics which is defined:
    \[r_{m} =   \frac{1}{n(n-1)/2-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n}
                (X_{i,j}-\hat{\mu}_X)(Y_{i,j}-\hat{\mu}_Y)/\hat{\sigma}_X\hat{\sigma}_Y.
    \]

    Mantel statistics primarily are used in the context of Hypothesis testing where it applied into
        related method called the mantel and partial mantel test.
    These are both permutation test that work under assumptions that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item   Each $i$ row and column both correspond to the same sample
        \item   The sample where taking independent of one another.
    \end{enumerate} %TODO check these.
